## About this project

I got a request from a man to make a maimai stuff, and here it is, that maimai stuff. That was a good idea considering maimai doesn't have an API to get stuff.

This repo exists because yes. I don't like keeping source code on my machine.

Also please don't abuse the image generation endpoint. It's still badly coded and waste a lot of memory, I guess.

## Little note on hosting

**You must have some keys defined in the code in order to use this!** I'll soon host an instance of this thing.

Well I mean it'll take some time to optimize the code before that but whatever.
